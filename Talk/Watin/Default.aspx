        From the web site: "WatiN (pronounced "what-in") stands for Web Application Testing
        in dotNet. Inspired by Watir, WatiN enables web application testing, through Internet
        Explorer on a Windows platform, expressed in any .Net language."</p>
    <p>
        Like Selenium, WatiN can be used
        to test non-ASP.NET web sites, but unlike Selenium
        only works with IE (6 or 7).&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
        WatiN was started in December of 2005.</p>
