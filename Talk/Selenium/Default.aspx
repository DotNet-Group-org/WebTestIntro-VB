        From the web site: "Selenium is a test tool for web applications. Selenium tests run directly in a browser, (Internet Explorer, Mozilla and Firefox on Windows, Linux,
        and Macintosh)."</p>
    <p>
        In addition, while NUnitAsp is limited ASP.NET web sites, Selenium can test any
        kind of web site.&nbsp; The Selenium Remote Control is literally a remote control
        for a browser.&nbsp;

        Selenium's roots go back
        to 2004, it grew out of a Javascript tester written by
        ThoughtWorks, the same folks who created Watir.&nbsp; For more about the differences
        between Selenium and Watir, check here: http://opensource.thoughtworks.com/papers/WatirAndSelenium.jsp</p>

        Selenium’s automation engine is written in JavaScript and runs inside a browser.
        All modern browsers support JavaScript, and therefore can be driven by Selenium.
        The automation engine, called a browser bot, is embedded in a page that accessed
        the application under test in a separate frame.</p>
